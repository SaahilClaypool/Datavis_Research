%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is

%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind

%% in the past.

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page

%% during the printing process.  Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the
%% first page will be refused.

%% These three lines bring in essential packages: ``mathptmx'' for Type 1

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Bayesian inference, despite being common in an increasingly data-driven world, is still difficult for many people to reason with. But, prior studies have shown that the visual presentation of this information can have a significant effect on the ability for people to understand this set of problems. We sought to evaluate whether an interactive visualization would further assist people dealing with Bayesian statistics. Through a small user study, we were not able to find any significant benefit from interactivity. Rather, there is some indication that interactivity confused participants, causing them to perform worse than when they were provided with just a static visualization.
